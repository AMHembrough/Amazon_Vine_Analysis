# Overview of the analysis


The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program, a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products to Amazon Vine members who are required to publish a review.  

The goal of the project was to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the selected dataset.  

# Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

There were 613 Vine member reviews and 64,934 non-member reviews.

222 of the 613 Vine member reviews were 5-star reviews.  30,530 of the 64,934 non-member reviews were 5-star reviews. 

36% of Vine member reviews were 5-star, while 47% of non-Vine member reviews were 5-star.

# Summary

There is not any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program, which is supported by the analysis.  

We should repeat this analysis but without filtering for “helpful reviews”.  This filter may have introduced external bias into our analysis.
